## Auditability

- Did you establish mechanisms that facilitate the AI system’s auditability (e.g. traceability of the development process, the sourcing of training data and the logging of the AI system’s processes, outcomes, positive and negative impact)?
- Did you ensure that the AI system can be audited by independent third parties?

## Tradeoffs/ Risk-management

- Did you foresee any kind of external guidance or third-party auditing processes to oversee ethical concerns and accountability measures?
- Does the involvement of these third parties go beyond the development phase?
- Did you organise risk training and, if so, does this also inform about the potential legal framework applicable to the AI system?
- Did you consider establishing an AI ethics review board or a similar mechanism to discuss the overall accountability and ethics practices, including potential unclear grey areas?
- Did you establish a process to discuss and continuously monitor and assess the AI system's adherence to this Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)?
- Does this process include identification and documentation of conflicts between the 6 aforementioned requirements or between different ethical principles and explanation of the 'trade-off' decisions made?
- Did you provide appropriate training to those involved in such a process and does this also cover the legal framework applicable to the AI system?
- Did you establish a process for third parties (e.g. suppliers, end-users, subjects, distributors/vendors or workers) to report potential vulnerabilities, risks or biases in the AI system?
- Does this process foster revision of the risk management process?
- For applications that can adversely affect individuals, have redress by design
mechanisms been put in place?

Requirement Title
Transparency, and Performance Measurement
Description of requirement
To address concerns related to the effectiveness, trust, and transparency of the diagnostic tool, it is essential to establish clear requirements for accuracy, transparency, and performance measurement. This requirement focuses on quantifying the accuracy of the tool, ensuring transparency in its predictions, and defining key performance metrics.



Requirement Title
Post-Prediction Outcome Feedback Collection Mechanism
Description of requirement
The ability of doctors and other healthcare professionals to provide feedback on incorrect predictions or patient outcomes, it is essential to establish a mechanism for post-prediction outcome feedback. This requirement focuses on creating a structured process for clinicians to report any discrepancies between predictions and actual patient outcomes. This focuses on the collection of this feedback


Requirement Title
Continuous Medical Professional Feedback Integration
Description of requirement
Ongoing medical professional feedback regarding medical applicability, it is crucial to establish a continuous feedback integration process. This requirement focuses on creating a system that allows medical professionals to provide feedback on the tool’s effectiveness, relevance, and alignment with evolving medical knowledge and practices. The aim is to ensure that the tool remains applicable and beneficial in the dynamic field of healthcare.

Requirement Title
Cost-Benefit and Budget Impact Analysis for Healthcare System
Description of requirement
Concerns about the tool’s cost-effectiveness compared to its value to the healthcare system, a comprehensive cost-benefit and budget impact analysis must be conducted. This requirement aims to ensure that the tool’s implementation is economically justified for the healthcare system, and aligns with its potential benefits.
