\chapter*{Overview}\label{overview}}

\markboth{Overview}{Overview}

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare poses
ethical risks. Dedicated efforts are essential to ensure that AI systems
in healthcare adhere to principles of lawfulness, ethics, and
robustness. We have developed a plan which outlines steps to mitigate
ethical risks and increase trustworthiness throughout the lifecycle of
the STRATIF-AI project. We draw on interdisciplinary expertise and align
our approach with three core strategies:

\textbf{(1) Operationalization:} Existing guidelines for AI development
often provide broad, high-level principles, which are suitable for a
wide range of AI systems. High-level principles must be translated to
actionable steps that are tailored to the specific traits of individual
AI systems. Our approach is designed to ensure that ethical principles
do not remain theoretical concepts---but are instead effectively
embedded into the design, implementation, and continuous management of
the STRATIF-AI system.

\textbf{(2) Co-creation:} We have adopted a co-creation process to
ensure equitable development of solutions. The content for this manual
has been developed in collaboration with key stakeholders within the
STRATIF-AI project, including clinicians, data scientists, medical
researchers, representatives from patient organizations, and project
coordinators. Engaging diverse stakeholders allows us to thoroughly
assess the risks and benefits associated with specific requirements. The
collaborative process fosters the creation of ethical requirements that
are not only necessary and feasible but also auditable, thus
contributing to the overall integrity and reliability of the STRATIF-AI
system.

\textbf{(3) Anticipation:} The STRATIF-AI project introduces several
novel technological solutions. Novel challenges may fall outside the
scope of existing ethical guidelines, and may thus be difficult to
address by simply adhering to current regulations or previously
published frameworks. To help mitigate novel ethical risks, we pay close
attention in our workshops and research to issues or concerns relevant
to digital twins in healthcare which may be yet unprecedented.

Overall, our ethical plan has been designed to facilitate the early
identification of potential ethical risks of the STRATIF-AI project and
ultimately enhance the system's trustworthiness and societal impact.

The goal of the framework is to enumerate project-specific requirements
that can help to mitigate ethical risks and increase trustworthiness
throughout the STRATIF-AI development process.

\hypertarget{design-and-use}{%

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Design and Use}

\markright{Design and Use}

Our framework has been designed to be a living document, and, as such,
will be revised following upcoming workshops, audits, and through
external validation.

The contents of the first version of the framework were developed based
on a series of co-creation workshops (see:
\protect\hyperlink{co-creation-workshops}{Workshops}).

Planned updates to the framework will follow \textbf{(1) a focused
stakeholder workshop series}, \textbf{(2) upcoming audits} of current
framework adherence and \textbf{(3) an external Z-inspection} of the AI
system.

\textbf{(1) A focused stakeholder workshop series} will be conducted to
complete the requirements outlined in this document. More specifically,
some requirements have been planned according to the current expertise,
knowledge, and timeline, but still lack specific information about
parameters, methods, key personnel or planned output. These details will
be completed in an iterative process during the forthcoming workshop
series.

\textbf{(2) Audits} are planned at five time points during the project,
at 6-month increments, to assess adherence to the framework, nominate
potential challenges, and suggest changes to resolve issues.

\textbf{(3) An external Z-inspection} will be conducted to assess the
trustworthiness of the STRATIF-AI platform. Z-inspection is a published
and validated gold standard method by which external experts use
sociotechnical scenarios to derive AI trustworthiness requirements. The
results of the Z-inspection process will be integrated into the
framework.

The Framework for Ethical and Trustworthy Design of the STRATIF-AI
platform has been designed in concordance with the (1)
\href{https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai}{\textbf{EU
Guidelines for Trustworthy AI}} and (2)
\href{https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/assessment-list-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence-altai-self-assessment}{\textbf{Assessment
List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI)}}.

\textbf{The EU Guidelines for Trustworthy AI} were developed on 8 April
2019 by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI
HLEG). The guidelines aim to promote three key principles to support the
development and deployment of safe AI systems---i.e., lawfulness, ethics
and robustness. The principles are expounded as seven key requirements
(Figure 1).

\end{figure}

\textbf{The Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence
(ALTAI)} was derived on 17 July 2020 by the High-Level Expert Group on
Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG), to aid AI developers in implementing
regulatory requirements in practice. This tool serves as a practical
instrument for assessing the compliance of AI systems with the current
legal and ethical framework.

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\section*{Structure}\label{structure}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Structure}

\markright{Structure}

Our framework is divided into seven sections, each corresponding to one
of seven requirements set forth by the EU Guidelines for Trustworthy AI:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{human-agency-and-oversight}{Human Agency and
  Oversight}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{technical-robustness-and-safety}{Technical

\item
  \protect\hyperlink{societal-and-environmental-well-being}{Societal and
  Environmental Wellbeing}
\item
  \protect\hyperlink{accountability}{Accountability}
\end{enumerate}

Under each section, we provide a preliminary assessment of the
STRATIF-AI platform following the questions included in the Assessment
List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) checklist.

We then describe a set of project-specific requirements. Under each
project-specific requirement, we outline a set of relevant information
that is either planned or \emph{requires revision.}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, breakable, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, titlerule=0mm, colback=white, opacityback=0, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm]

Under each requirement, we delineate information that requires revision
and will be updated following workshops/audits in \emph{italic text}.

\end{tcolorbox}

\hypertarget{requirement-template}{%
\subsection*{Requirement Template}\label{requirement-template}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Requirement Template}

\textbf{Description} We describe each requirement briefly and nominate
specific \textbf{\emph{parameters}} which need to be expounded or
addressed.

\textbf{\emph{parameters:}} We identify specific parameters within each
requirement. These parameters help to add precision to the attribute,
goal, or entity described by the parameter word.

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, breakable, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, titlerule=0mm, colback=white, opacityback=0, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm]

When a parameter has been defined, it is delineated by plain text. If a
parameter is yet to be defined, we provide \emph{prompts which will help
to define parameters in future workshops, which are delineated by italic
text}.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Owner}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Each requirement has an ``Owner'', who is responsible for its
  implementation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Personnel}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Several stakeholders may serve as key personnel to contribute to or
  facilitate progress towards this requirement. Named personnel are
  \emph{TBD} and will be identified in upcoming workshops.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, breakable, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-note-color!10!white, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, titlerule=0mm, colback=white, opacityback=0, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-note-color}{\faInfo}\hspace{0.5em}{Note}, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-note-color-frame, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm]

Some information will need to be completed in upcoming focused
stakeholder workshops and planned audits. We use \emph{TBD} (to be
determined) to delineate information that needs to be addressed in
workshops and audits.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Schedule} A preliminary schedule will be devised.

\textbf{Stroke Phase} We identify whether this requirement pertains to
all phases of stroke (prevention, acute treatment, rehabilitation) that
the STRATIF-AI tool intends to treat.

\textbf{Actionable tasks}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Here we list a set of tasks
\item
  Which will be executed
\item
  In order to successfully meet this requirement
\item
  These lists will be updated in subsequent audits
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{requirement-example}{%
\subsection*{Requirement Example}\label{requirement-example}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Requirement Example}

\textbf{Description} Explainability materials will be
\textbf{\emph{customized}} for specific \textbf{\emph{end-users}}.

\textbf{\emph{end-users:}} patients; medical professionals\\
\textbf{\emph{customized:}} available in video format; available in
written format

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, breakable, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, titlerule=0mm, colback=white, opacityback=0, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Tip}, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm]

``End-user'' could refer to a variety of entities---e.g., patients or
medical professionals. Parameterizing attributes, goals, or entities
mentioned in requirements helps to make the requirement more flexible,
less ambiguous, and easier to implement.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Owner}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  WP3
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Personnel}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  WP2
\item
  WP1
\item
  technical staff \emph{TBD}
\item
  modelling staff \emph{TBD}
\item
  medical staff \emph{TBD}
\item
  patient representatives \emph{TBD}
\end{itemize}

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, breakable, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, titlerule=0mm, colback=white, opacityback=0, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Tip}, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm]

To complete this requirement, we will require input from modellers/WP2,
data scientists/WP1, as well as feedback from end-users---clinicians and
patients.\emph{TBD} denotes that key personnel will need to be named
(``to be determined'') in upcoming workshops and audits.

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Schedule} At any point, before the end of the project.

\textbf{Stroke Phase} EACH (3)

\begin{tcolorbox}[enhanced jigsaw, arc=.35mm, breakable, coltitle=black, toptitle=1mm, colbacktitle=quarto-callout-tip-color!10!white, toprule=.15mm, left=2mm, bottomrule=.15mm, opacitybacktitle=0.6, titlerule=0mm, colback=white, opacityback=0, title=\textcolor{quarto-callout-tip-color}{\faLightbulb}\hspace{0.5em}{Tip}, bottomtitle=1mm, colframe=quarto-callout-tip-color-frame, leftrule=.75mm, rightrule=.15mm]

This requirement will need to be addressed for all intended use-cases of
the STRATIF-AI platform. This means that the tasks necessary to complete
the requirement, and the planned output (here: video/written material),
should be completed each for patients at risk of stroke (prevention
phase), patients with stroke (acute phase), and patients recovering from
stroke (rehabilitation phase).

\end{tcolorbox}

\textbf{Actionable tasks}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  appoint key personnel
\item
  create prototype for explainability
\item
  feedback from WP1/WP2/technical staff
\item
  update prototype
\item
  translate for different end-users
\item
  feedback from end-users

A series of workshops were conducted with STRATIF-AI consortium members
to define issues, requirements, and solutions regarding the design of an
ethical and trustworthy AI system. The workshops were designed following
feedback from a similar program, which was developed for the EU Horizon
project ``VALIDATE'' and executed in 2023.

Workshops were conducted in March 2024 and comprised a diversity of
participants from within the STRATIF-AI consortium. The planned duration
of each workshop was 3.5 hours; the final workshop duration was between
3 and 3.5 hours. All workshops, with the exception of the first, were
facilitated by Riana Minocher (CUB). The first workshop was facilitated
by Riana Minocher (CUB) with assistance from Gabriele Pluktaite (CUB).
All consortium members who are subscribed to the STRATIF-AI email list
were invited to register their participation via a Google form.

\markright{Methodology}

The first workshop functioned as a pilot session. Resources/exercises
were modified following the first session to accommodate feedback from
participants and informal reflections. Participants received an email
the day before the workshop with information and instructions on how to
participate. Workshops were conducted on Microsoft Teams. Mural was used
to disseminate materials and facilitate note-taking during discussions.

Each workshop was divided into three sections:

\textbf{1. Introduction and warmup}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Introduction by facilitator to list workshop goals and overview
\item
  Participant introductions using sticky-notes in Mural
\item
  Creativity game: to warm up and practice using Mural
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Understand concepts}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Free-list in answer to prompt ``What ethical concerns come to mind
  when you think of STRATIF-AI?''
\item
  Discuss EU requirements meanings/associations
\item
  Map EU requirements to STRATIF-AI project workflow
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Define concrete requirements}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Demo of STRATIF-AI framework site
\item
  Discuss requirements/solutions within groups
\end{itemize}

The phase ``Understand concepts'' was intended to serve as a primer for
participants about various ethical issues that have been defined by
governing bodies, and to begin to think about how such issues might be
related to the STRATIF-AI project. Exposure to requirements and
terminology was deemed necessary to guide discussion in the phase
``Define concrete requirements''. In this phase, participants were
expected to highlight project-specific concerns, which may pertain to
their expertise, interest or own personal health history.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{General Reflections}

The workshops were generally well-received. In Workshop 1, participants
discussed topics within their expertise with enthusiasm, but some noted
the insufficient time to cover all possible content. The suggestion for
follow-up workshops, which could be tailored to specific stakeholder
roles, was made. Workshop 2 saw broad awareness of potential risks and
discussion of potential abuse of AI within healthcare. Workshop 3 faced
some technical challenges, due to difficulties with using Mural
effectively, but this did not prevent a serious discussion about risks,
roles and responsibilities. Finally, Workshop 4 engaged only two
participants, but of complementary backgrounds, which fostered a
detailed discussion about the trade-offs between data protection and
model performance. Overall, the workshops provided valuable insights and
highlighted the need for ongoing dialogue about ethical considerations
within the STRATIF-AI project.

\hypertarget{key-themes}{%
\subsection*{Key Themes}\label{key-themes}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Key Themes}

Discussion during workshops highlighted several recurrent themes that
appeared important to resolve. We summarize these below to help
contextualize the content of different requirements within the Framework
for Ethical and Trustworthy Design of the STRATIF-AI platform (See:
\protect\hyperlink{framework}{Framework}).

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Data Ownership}: Participants discussed considerations
  regarding data ownership, re-use, quality, and bias extensively. They
  emphasized the importance of patient data control, particularly
  regarding stewardship of data in the event of death or disability, the
  potential to re-use data for studies, the process of obtaining
  informed consent for data use, and the novel challenges presented by
  the data harmonization and federated learning processes.
\item
  \textbf{Transparency}: A significant focus was placed on ensuring
  transparency in AI systems to empower patients and clinicians, and
  maintain their trust. Discussions highlighted the challenge of
  effectively conveying the meaning behind technical terms such as
  ``prediction uncertainty'' to citizens. Similarly, the challenge of
  developing transparent models which are accessible to clinicians and
  patients of varying goals and experience was discussed.
\item
  \textbf{Patient Empowerment}: Discussion in workshops underscored the
  importance of patient empowerment in the AI-driven healthcare
  landscape. Participants emphasized the need for patients to have
  control over their data, and for AI systems to provide understandable
  and actionable insights to empower informed decision-making. The need
  to communicate insights without causing harm to mental or emotional
  wellbeing was identified.
\item
  \textbf{Personalized Prevention}: Participants emphasized the
  significance of a user-centric approach, especially in tailoring
  prevention programs to diversity of end-users. In addition to
  fostering patient control, physicians should also have autonomy over
  the type of model and outcome used to make predictions. The potential
  benefits of personalized health coaching through digital twins were
  also discussed as potentially driving behavioral change and
  contributing to broader societal wellbeing.
\item
  \textbf{A Common Language for Health}: Several participants raised the
  importance of integrating discussions across diverse stakeholder
  groups and defining a common language for health. Addressing
  disparities in health literacy and ensuring equitable distribution of
  AI platforms across communities were highlighted as key
  considerations.

\chapter{Human Agency and Oversight}\label{human-agency-and-oversight}}

Respect for human autonomy encompasses respect for a democratic,
flourishing, and equitable society. This involves the prioritization of
user agency and necessitating human oversight of the AI system. This
requirement is particularly important for AI systems which guide or
influence human decision-making---and is thus of central importance to
the STRATIF-AI project.

\textbf{Definitions:} human-in-the-loop (HITL): capability for human
intervention in every decision cycle of the system human-on-the-loop
(HOTL): capability for human intervention during the design cycle of the
system and monitoring the system's operation human-in-command (HIC):
capability to oversee the overall activity of the AI system (including
its broader economic, societal, legal and ethical impact) and the
ability to decide when and how to use the AI system in any particular
situation---e.g., override decision or discontinue use

\hypertarget{altai-assessment}{%
\subsection*{ALTAI assessment}\label{altai-assessment}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{ALTAI assessment}

STRATIF-AI is intended to guide decisions made by human
end-users---i.e., both doctors and patients---, and these decisions are
in turn projected to impact the decisions of end-users (patients' health
and autonomy, as well as doctors' autonomy) and society in general. To
ensure STRATIF-AI does not generate confusion about the extent the
allocation of epistemic authority, a plan to disseminate information in
an accessible manner to a diversity of end-users will be necessary. The
risk of interpretation of a digital twin as a human rather than AI
system is potentially low, but a risk assessment needs to be made to
rule out this possibility. The risk of addiction or unhealthy attachment
to the system are again deemed low, but measures to mitigate or minimize
the risk of such activities need to be developed. The risk of
manipulation needs to be investigated.

must be guard against vulnerability to attack by third parties which
could compromise its integrity or alter its behaviour. Safety procedures
to enact in the event of errors or risks must be instituted. The
accuracy of the system is of critical importance where the case for
AI-assisted medical decision-making. Finally, reproducibility and

The risks associated with the AI system for each use-case will be
assessed through pilot and clinical studies. Procedures to continuously
measure and access risks will be devised, validated and implemented. A
plan to inform end-users of existing and potential risks will be made.
STRATIF-AI is a novel concept and technology; possible threats and
vulnerability to misuse should additionally be explored through
additional research. Stability and reliability of the system will
continually be assessed throughout model development. A plan to
regularly evaluate the system, upon changes to technical infrastructure,
will also be devised.

\chapter{Transparency}\label{transparency}}

A key requirement for ethical AI is transparency. Transparency includes
traceability of the AI system and its decisions, i.e., all information
and procedures which led to the system's predictions. Such traceability
is essential to enable the identification of errors and improvement of
future results. Traceability is closely linked to explainability, which
is the ability to explain the technical processes and the human
oversight procedures in place within the AI system. STRATIF-AI is a
complex CDSS involving numerous technological solutions and a HIC
governance process---the limits of which should be clearly communicated
to end-users. High explainability may come at the cost of system
accuracy: if increases in accuracy necessitate a high degree of
complexity. The degree to which AI predictions affect human decisions
should be balanced with the ability to explain the rationale behind such
decisions. Finally, the the degree to which human decisions depend on AI
predictions, and the underlying limitations of the system and its
predictions, must be communicated in an interpretable manner to a
diversity end-users.

The impacts of the AI system on the wellbeing of society must be
considered throughout its life cycle. A system which is encountered in
aspects of daily life---e.g., healthcare---has the potential to
negatively impact mental health and emotional wellbeing. Such effects
must be carefully considered and mitigated. Additonally, the
sustainability of the AI system under development must be a point of
discussion, such that the development and utilization of an AI system
benefits all human beings, including future generations. Finally, the
system must not undermine democratic processes or pose a threat to
democratic society.

AI systems should be as environmentally friendly as possible. The

waste. During the development of the STRATIF-AI project, the potential
of negative harm on the environment needs to be systematically
considered. Measuring the environmental impact through energy consumed

STRATIF-AI will be designed with a human-in-command governance system

clinical decision-support system, STRATIF-AI will potentially have
significant impacts on human work and work arrangements, necessitating a
thorough assessment through an implementation strategy. While medical
professionals will play a central role in the development pipeline of
STRATIF-AI, broader inclusion and consultation with potentially affected
workers and their representatives will be carried out. Measures to

\chapter{Accountability}\label{accountability}}

The principle of accountability highlights the need to establish
mechanisms to guarantee responsibility throughout the lifecycle of AI
systems. This principle intersects closely with risk management
practices, which involve transparently identifying and mitigating risks
that can be comprehended and audited by external parties. In instances
where unjust or adverse impacts arise, accessible mechanisms for
accountability must be established, to facilitate the opportunity for
redress to affected parties.

The auditability of STRATIF-AI's workflow and system lifecycle is a
fundamental aspect of our ethical plan. By creating a living document,
we aim to establish a transparent and traceable log of all measures
taken to adhere to ethical principles and legal requirements. To ensure
the AI system can be audited by independent third parties, the ethical
plan will be made available or disseminated accordingly.

It is essential to identify, assess, document, and mitigate potential
negative impacts of AI systems, particularly for those directly or
indirectly affected. Safeguards must be in place to protect
whistleblowers, NGOs, trade unions, and other entities reporting
legitimate concerns about AI systems. As part of WP3 within the
STRATIF-AI project, we will conduct an external Z-inspection assessment,
which is a gold-standard and validated methodology to assess the ethical
impacts of an AI tool. A comprehensive risk training protocol will be
designed and adhere to any legal protocols. Our ethical plan has been
designed in concordance with the Assessment List for Trustworthy AI
(ALTAI), and, as such, will be continually evaluated throughout the AI
system's lifecycle.

While implementing these requirements, tensions may arise, necessitating
inevitable trade-offs. We will identify relevant interests and values
implicated by the AI system and explicitly evaluate trade-offs in terms
of their risk to safety and ethical principles, including fundamental
rights. These decisions will be thoroughly documented throughout our
ethical audit process. Additionally, a a process for third parties
(e.g.~suppliers, end-users, subjects, distributors/vendors or workers)
to report potential vulnerabilities, risks or biases in the AI system,
and a following risk management protocol will be instituted. Accessible
mechanisms to ensure adequate redress will be established.
