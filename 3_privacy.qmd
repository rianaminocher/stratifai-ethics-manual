## Privacy

**Questions:**

-   Did you consider the impact of the AI system on the right to privacy, the right to physical, mental and/or moral integrity and the right to data protection?
-   Depending on the use case, did you establish mechanisms that allow flagging issues related to privacy concerning the AI system?

**Solutions:**

## Data governance

**Questions:**

-   Is your AI system being trained, or was it developed, by using or processing personal data (including special categories of personal data)?
-   Did you put in place any of the following measures some of which are mandatory under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or a non-European equivalent?
-   Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
-   Designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO) and include them at an early state in the development, procurement or use phase of the AI system
-   Oversight mechanisms for data processing (including limiting access to qualified personnel, mechanisms for logging data access and making modifications);
-   Measures to achieve privacy-by-design and default (e.g. encryption, pseudonymisation, aggregation, anonymisation)
-   Data minimisation, in particular personal data (including special categories of data);
-   Did you implement the right to withdraw consent, the right to object and the right to be forgotten into the development of the AI system?
-   Did you consider the privacy and data protection implications of data collected, generated or processed over the course of the AI system's life cycle?
-   Did you consider the privacy and data protection implications of the AI system's non-personal training-data or other processed non-personal data?
-   Did you align the AI system with relevant standards (e.g. ISO25, IEEE26) or widely adopted protocols for (daily) data management and governance?
