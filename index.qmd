This framework has been developed in concordance with requirements within the EU Horizon Project [STRATIF-AI](https://stratif-ai.eu/en) [Grant No. 101080875].

# Background {.unnumbered #background}

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare poses ethical risks. Dedicated efforts are essential to ensure that AI systems in healthcare adhere to principles of lawfulness, ethics, and robustness. We have developed a plan which outlines steps to mitigate ethical risks and increase trustworthiness throughout the lifecycle of the STRATIF-AI project. We draw on interdisciplinary expertise and align our approach with three core strategies:

**(1) Operationalization:** Existing guidelines for AI development often provide broad, high-level principles, which are suitable for a wide range of AI systems. High-level principles must be translated to actionable steps that are tailored to the specific traits of individual AI systems. Our approach is designed to ensure that ethical principles do not remain theoretical concepts---but are instead effectively embedded into the design, implementation, and continuous management of the STRATIF-AI system. 

**(2) Co-creation:** We have adopted a co-creation process to ensure equitable development of solutions. The content for this manual has been developed in collaboration with key stakeholders within the STRATIF-AI project, including clinicians, data scientists, medical researchers, representatives from patient organizations, and project coordinators. Engaging diverse stakeholders allows us to thoroughly assess the risks and benefits associated with specific requirements. The collaborative process fosters the creation of ethical requirements that are not only necessary and feasible but also auditable, thus contributing to the overall integrity and reliability of the STRATIF-AI system. 

**(3) Anticipation:** The STRATIF-AI project introduces several novel technological solutions. Novel challenges may fall outside the scope of existing ethical guidelines, and may thus be difficult to address by simply adhering to current regulations or previously published frameworks. To help mitigate novel ethical risks, we pay close attention in our workshops and research to issues or concerns relevant to digital twins in healthcare which may be yet unprecedented. 

Overall, our ethical plan has been designed to facilitate the early identification of potential ethical risks of the STRATIF-AI project and ultimately enhance the system's trustworthiness and societal impact.
