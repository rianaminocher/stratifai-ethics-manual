# Societal and Environmental Well-being

**Principle:**   
prevention of harm and fairness

**Requirements:**  
(1) sustainability and ecological responsibility  
(2) beneficial to all human beings and future generations  
(3) foster democratic processes  

## Sustainable and environmentally friendly AI

### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}

- Are there potential negative impacts of the AI system on the environment? o Which potential impact(s) do you identify?
- Where possible, did you establish mechanisms to evaluate the environmental impact of the AI system’s development, deployment and/or use (for example, the amount of energy used and carbon emissions)?
- Did you define measures to reduce the environmental impact of the AI system throughout its lifecycle?

## Social impact

### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}

- Does the AI system impact human work and work arrangements?
- Did you pave the way for the introduction of the AI system in your organisation by informing and consulting with impacted workers and their representatives (trade
unions, (European) work councils) in advance?
- Did you adopt measures to ensure that the impacts of the AI system on human work
are well understood?
- Did you ensure that workers understand how the AI system operates, which
capabilities it has and which it does not have?
- Could the AI system create the risk of de-skilling of the workforce?
- Did you take measures to counteract de-skilling risks? 
- Does the system promote or require new (digital) skills?
- Did you provide training opportunities and materials for re- and up-skilling?

## Society and democracy

### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}

- Could the AI system have a negative impact on society at large or democracy?
- Did you assess the societal impact of the AI system’s use beyond the (end-)user and subject, such as potentially indirectly affected stakeholders or society at large?
- Did you take action to minimize potential societal harm of the AI system? o Did you take measures that ensure that the AI system does not negatively impact democracy?

VALIDATE machine learning engineers follow an SOP to reduce the environmental impact of model training.

Environmental Impact of AI System in Healthcare
Description of requirement
Training AI models and running sophisticated algorithms require significant computational power, which can lead to high energy consumption, potentially leading to a larger carbon footprint.


Monitoring and Analysis of Cost-Benefit for Patients Description of requirement To address the dilemma of cost versus benefits in using the diagnostic tool, it is crucial to establish a comprehensive cost benefit analysis and monitoring framework that focuses on patient outcome and well-being.

Trade-off
Monetary Cost vs. Benefits to Patient
Description In order for the tool to be worthwhile, the developers must show that it provides a positive return on investment for all stakeholders, especially the patients. If the cost of using the tool is greater than the potential life-saving benefits, then it should not be used.
