# Transparency  

**Principle:**   

**Requirements:**  
(1) traceability  
(2) explainability: building trust  
(3) open communication/ limitations  

**Keywords:**  
AI System, end-user, explicability, lifecycle, subject, traceability, workflow of the model

## Traceability

**Questions:**   

- Did you put in place measures that address the traceability of the AI system during its entire lifecycle?
- Did you put in place measures to continuously assess the quality of the input data to the AI system?
- Can you trace back which data was used by the AI system to make a certain decision(s) or recommendation(s)?
- Can you trace back which AI model or rules led to the decision(s) or recommendation(s) of the AI system?
- Did you put in place measures to continuously assess the quality of the output(s) of the AI system?
- Did you put adequate logging practices in place to record the decision(s) or recommendation(s) of the AI system?

## Explainability

**Questions:**  

- Did you explain the decision(s) of the AI system to the users?29
- Do you continuously survey the users if they understand the decision(s) of the AI
system?

**Solutions:**  

## Communication

**Questions:**  

- In cases of interactive AI systems (e.g., chatbots, robo-lawyers), do you communicate to users that they are interacting with an AI system instead of a human?
- Did you establish mechanisms to inform users about the purpose, criteria and limitations of the decision(s) generated by the AI system?
- Did you communicate the benefits of the AI system to users?
- Did you communicate the technical limitations and potential risks of the AI
system to users, such as its level of accuracy and/ or error rates?
- Did you provide appropriate training material and disclaimers to users on how
to adequately use the AI system?
