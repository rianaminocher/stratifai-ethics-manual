{"title":"Transparency","markdown":{"headingText":"Transparency","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nA key requirement for ethical AI is transparency. Transparency includes traceability of the AI system and its decisions, i.e., all information and procedures which led to the system's predictions. Such traceability is essential to enable the identification of errors and improvement of future results. Traceability is closely linked to explainability, which is the ability to explain the technical processes and the human oversight procedures in place within the AI system. STRATIF-AI is a complex CDSS involving numerous technological solutions and a HIC governance process---the limits of which should be clearly communicated to end-users. High explainability may come at the cost of system accuracy: if increases in accuracy necessitate a high degree of complexity. The degree to which AI predictions affect human decisions should be balanced with the ability to explain the rationale behind such decisions. Finally, the the degree to which human decisions depend on AI predictions, and the underlying limitations of the system and its predictions, must be communicated in an interpretable manner to a diversity end-users. \n\n**Keywords:**  \nAI System, end-user, explicability, lifecycle, subject, traceability, workflow of the model\n\n## Traceability\n\n### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nTraceability is difficult to achieve for complex data-driven AI systems. STRATIF-AI will be engineered with measures to enable traceability of the system as far as possible. The ability to trace back data, data quality, and decision rules of the system will be quantified, assessed, and reported to end-users. The decisions of the system and the associated \"quality\" of such decisions will be continuously monitored.\n\n### Enable system traceability\n\n**Description**  The ability to trace back key ***system parameters*** will be ***assessed*** systematically and translated for a diversity of ***end-users***. \n\n***system parameters:*** data source; data demographics; patient-specific data; model parameters; model calibration metrics;  \n***assessed:*** *a system within the platform to report data*  \n***end-users:*** medical professionals; patients;  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP2\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n* technical staff *TBD*\n* medical staff *TBD*\n* patient representatives\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** EACH (3)\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define system parameters that should be identified\n* design platform/system to assess/enable info\n* feedback from end-users on system and params\n* translation of outputs\n* feedback from end-users on interpretability of output\n* publication of traceability system\n\n### Quality control of predictions\n\n**Description**  The ***decisions*** of the system must be ***systematically compared*** with ***human feedback*** to infer prediction ***quality***. \n\n***decisions:*** predictions; prediction intervals; data output  \n***systematically compared:*** *design of study comparison*  \n***human feedback:*** *discrepancy with medical decision; patient discomfort;*    \n***quality:*** *construct a quality score*  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP2\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n* WP3\n* technical staff *TBD*\n* medical staff *TBD*\n* patient representatives\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** EACH (3)\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define decisions to be recorded and feedback format\n* design platform within app to do so\n* construct quality score\n* study design and preregistration\n* publication of quality of decisions/ update to system\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis requirement is closely connected with requirements under section [Human Agency and Oversight](1_oversight.qmd).\n::: \n\n## Explainability\n\n### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nSTRATIF-AI is a clinical decision support-system.

However, the HIC governance concept must be clearly communicated to end-users. The benefits, technical limitations, potential risks must additionally be communicated to end-users in a transparent and explainable manner. A comprehensive training protocol for end-users---particularly medical personnel---must be developed in collaboration with the system developers. \n\n### Standardize training materials\n\n**Description** Instructions about ***appropriate application*** of the STRATIF-AI must be ***adapted*** for a ***end-users*** of different ***subgroups***. \n\n***appropriate application:*** technical limitations; potential risks; error rates; evidence-based health benefits;  \n***adapted:*** available as written manual; flyer; video   \n***end-users:*** medical professionals; patients    \n***subgroups:*** *experience levels; patients; education; age; language; disability*\n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP7\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n* technical staff (TBD)\n* medical staff (TBD)\n* patient representatives\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** EACH (3)\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define proper use parameters\n* interview/feedback from key personnel\n* make prototype written and flyer materials\n* outsource video/audio materials\n* translation for disability, language, education, age\n* publication of materials\n\n### Tailor explainability material\n\n**Description** An overview of STRATIF-AI system ***functions*** and ***outputs*** will be communicated in a diversity of ***formats***, designed specifically for ***end-users*** of different ***subgroups***. \n\n***functions:*** modelling framework; modelling maps; decision-making process; training data; private data vault; security protocols; human oversight; evidence of efficacy; rationale for using tool;   ]\n***outputs:*** *TBD; model output*\n***formats:*** available as written manual; video; flyer;   \n***end-users:*** medical professionals; patients  \n***subgroups:*** *education; age; language; disability*  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP3\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n* WP7\n* technical staff *TBD*\n* medical staff *TBD*\n* patient representatives\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** EACH (3)\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define parameters\n* interview/feedback from key personnel\n* refine content\n* make prototype written and flyer materials\n* outsource video/audio materials\n* translation for disability, language, education, age\n* publication of materials\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nRequirements 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 are closely related. Requirement 4.3.1 involves the creation of training materials for use of the platform, i.e., serving as the guide for use, while Requirement 4.3.2 will deliver the explainability materials, i.e.,
