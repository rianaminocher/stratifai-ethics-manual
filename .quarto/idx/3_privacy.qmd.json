A Data Protection Impact Assessment will be executed, relevant Data Protection Officers will be appointed, and the requirements under General Data Protection Regulation will be adhered to. In addition, mechanisms to ensure oversight of data processing, data transformation and data harmonization within the Federated Learning environment will be drafted. Data minimization possibilities will need to be investigated. The right to withdraw consent, right to object, and right to be forgotten will be revised and communicated to end-users. The AI system will be aligned with relevant standards and widely adopted protocols within the relevant regulatory framework.\n\n### Assess data quality \n\n**Description** A quality control system to ensure different ***data types*** fulfil ***quality critera*** will be implemented and made available to ***end-users*** before use for model training or prediction. \n\n***data type:*** datasets; training data; Personal Data Vault  \n***quality criteria:*** TBD; missing data; inaccuracies; errors; relevant thresholds  \n***end-users:*** patients; medical professionals  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n* WP1\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n* design staff (TBD)\n* technical staff (TBD)\n* WP1 (TBD)\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** ALL\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define quality control metrics and acceptable thresholds\n* update any existing process protocols\n* produce quantitative assessments for existing data/prototype data\n* translate assessment for end-users\n\n### Standardize Federated Learning data procedures\n\n**Description** The ***procedures*** involved in manipulating training data for Federated Learning across project ***partners*** must be standardized. \n\nStandardise the complex procedures and protocols involved in federated learning across project organizations and countries.
