The system must be guard against vulnerability to attack by third parties which could compromise its integrity or alter its behaviour. Safety procedures to enact in the event of errors or risks must be instituted. The accuracy of the system is of critical importance where the case for AI-assisted medical decision-making. Finally, reproducibility and reliability help to ensure that the performance and behaviour of AI system can be critically assessed.\n\n**Keywords:**\naccuracy, AI Bias, AI System, AI Reliability, AI Reproducibility, (Low) Confidence Score, Continual Learning, Data Poisoning, Model Evasion, Model Inversion, Pen Test, Red-team\n\n## Resilience to attack and security\n\n### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nIn the event of technical faults, misuse or defect, STRATIF-AI could have damaging effects to human safety. The risk of vulnerability to cyber-attacks will be evaluated to ensure the system is made compliant with security standards under the Cybersecurity Act in Europe. Vulnerability to data poisoning, model evasion, model inversion will be addressed throughout model validation and testing. Measures to ensure robustness to attacks after the system has been deployed will be designed. The expected timeframe of validity for security measures need to be defined. \n\n### Define trade-offs in Federated Learning\n\n**Description** Measures to assess whether federated learning exposes patients to ***risks*** by various ***parties*** must be established, assessed and reported.   \n \n***risks:*** model inversion (information in parameters to reconstruct data); data leakage; data poisoning  \n***parties:*** internal (consortium); beneficiaries (collaborators); external  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP1\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n-   technical staff (TBD)\n\n**Schedule**  During model training.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** ALL\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define list of risks and parties\n* document measures to assess risks \n* verify metrics are sufficient to dissuade concerns about vulnerability\n* publish validation study\n\n### Comply with cybersecurity law\n\n**Description** The system must be made compliant with the ***relevant cybersecurity legislation***. \n \n***relevant cybersecurity legislation***: EU; country-specific; global\n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP7\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n- technical staff (TBD)\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project. \n\n**Stroke Phase** ALL\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define relevant legislation/ compliance categories\n\n### Establish emergency protocols\n\n**Description** In the event of a breach to security, a process protocol based on the ***severity*** of the attack must be followed. \n \n***severity:*** TBD; data poisoning; model evasion;  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP2\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n- technical staff (TBD)\n- WP7\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project. \n\n**Stroke Phase** ALL\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define severity levels for attack\n* define parameters for process protocols\n* external validation of process protocols\n\n## General safety\n\n### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nThe risks associated with the AI system for each use-case will be assessed through pilot and clinical studies. Procedures to continuously measure and access risks will be devised, validated and implemented. A plan to inform end-users of existing and potential risks will be disseminated. STRATIF-AI is a novel concept and technology; possible threats and vulnerability to misuse will additionally be explored through a systematic literature review of ethical dilemmas regarding the use of digital twins in healthcare. Stability and reliability of the system will continually be assessed throughout model development.
