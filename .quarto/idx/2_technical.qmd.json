{"title":"Technical Robustness and Safety","markdown":{"headingText":"Technical Robustness and Safety","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nAI systems must be technically robust to prevent harm, unintentional or otherwise, to human dignity, mental and physical integrity. The system must be guard against vulnerability to attack by third parties which could compromise its integrity or alter its behaviour. Safety procedures to enact in the event of errors or risks must be instituted. The accuracy of the system is of critical importance where the case for AI-assisted medical decision-making. Finally, reproducibility and reliability help to ensure that the performance and behaviour of AI system can be critically assessed.\n\n## Resilience to attack and security\n\n### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nIn the event of technical faults, misuse or defect, STRATIF-AI could have damaging effects to human safety. The risk of vulnerability to cyber-attacks will be evaluated to ensure the system is made compliant with security standards under the Cybersecurity Act in Europe. Vulnerability to data poisoning, model evasion, model inversion will be addressed throughout model validation and testing. Measures to ensure robustness to attacks after the system has been deployed will be designed. The expected timeframe of validity for security measures need to be defined. \n\n### Define risks of Federated Learning\n\n**Description** Measures to assess whether federated learning exposes patients to ***risks*** must be established, assessed and reported.   \n \n***risks:*** model inversion (information in parameters to reconstruct data); data leakage; data poisoning  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP1\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n-   technical staff *TBD*\n\n**Schedule**  During model training.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** ALL\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define list of risks and parties\n* document measures to assess risks \n* verify metrics are sufficient to dissuade concerns about vulnerability\n* publish validation study\n\n### Comply with cybersecurity law\n\n**Description** The system must be made compliant with the ***relevant cybersecurity norms and legislation***. \n \n***relevant cybersecurity norms and legislation***: EU; country-specific; global\n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP7\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n- technical staff *TBD*\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project. \n\n**Stroke Phase** ALL\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define relevant legislation/ compliance categories\n\n### Establish emergency protocols\n\n**Description** In the event of a breach to security, a process protocol based on the ***severity*** and ***type*** of attack must be followed. \n \n***severity:*** *TBD define metrics to measure security breach, and scale of severity*  \n***type:*** data poisoning; model evasion; *TBD define types*  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP2\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n- technical staff *TBD*\n- WP7\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project. \n\n**Stroke Phase** ALL\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define severity levels for attack\n* define parameters for process protocols\n* external validation of process protocols\n\n## General safety\n\n### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nThe risks associated with the AI system for each use-case will be assessed through pilot and clinical studies. Procedures to continuously measure and access risks will be devised, validated and implemented. A plan to inform end-users of existing and potential risks will be made. STRATIF-AI is a novel concept and technology; possible threats and vulnerability to misuse should additionally be explored through additional research. Stability and reliability of the system will continually be assessed throughout model development. A plan to regularly evaluate the system, upon changes to technical infrastructure, will also be devised. \n\n### Assess risk of use\n\n**Description** An independent ***risk assessment*** of use of the STRATIF-AI platform for different ***end-users*** must be carried out.\n\n***risk assessment:*** *a standardized risk assessment must be designed*  \n***end-users:*** patients; patients with stroke; patients at risk of stroke; patients without stroke; *language; education; age; disability; medical professionals; doctors; physiotherapists; psychologists; care-workers; proficiency-levels; learner; proficient; expert*  \n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP4\n- WP5\n- WP6\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n- medical staff *TBD*\n- patients/patient representatives *TBD*\n- WP3\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project. \n\n**Stroke Phase** EACH (3)\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define end-users and risk assessment framework\n* develop protocol for clinical study/pilot study\n* conduct risk assessment \n* publish risk assessment\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThis requirement will focus on creating a general risk assessment for the tool.
