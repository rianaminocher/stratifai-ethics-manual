{"title":"Human Agency and Oversight","markdown":{"headingText":"Human Agency and Oversight","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe need to ensure respect for human autonomy encompasses the respect for a democratic, flourishing, and equitable society; the prioritization of user agency; and the necessity of human oversight for activities/uses of the AI system. This requirement is particularly important for AI systems which guide or influence human decision-making---and is thus of central importance to the STRATIF-AI project. \n\n**Keywords:**\nguiding, influencing, decision-making (e.g., prediction systems, predictive policing, decision-support); human-like; trust and (in)dependence\n\n**Definitions:**\nhuman-in-the-loop (HITL): capability for human intervention in every decision cycle of the system\nhuman-on-the-loop (HOTL): capability for human intervention during the design cycle of the system and monitoring the system's operation\nhuman-in-command (HIC): capability to oversee the overall activity of the AI system (including its broader economic, societal, legal and ethical impact) and the ability to decide when and how to use the AI system in any particular situation---e.g., override decision or discontinue use\n\n## Human agency and autonomy\n\n### ALTAI assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nSTRATIF-AI is intended to guide decisions made by human end-users---i.e., both doctors and patients---, which are in turn projected to impact end-users (patients' health and autonomy, as well as doctors' autonomy) and society in general. To ensure STRATIF-AI does not generate confusion about the extent to which decision-making is guided by algorithms and the allocation of epistemic authority, a plan to disseminate information in an accessible manner to a diversity of end-users will be necessary. The risk of interpretation of a digital twin or ``personalized health coach'' as a human rather than AI system is generally believed to be low, but a risk assessment needs to be made to rule out this possibility. The risk of addiction or unhealthy attachment to the system are again deemed low, but measures to mitigate or minimize the risk of such activities need to be developed. The risk of manipulation needs to be investigated. \n\n### Define epistemic authority\n\n**Description**  In the events where there is a ***discrepancy*** between the predictions of the tool and the medical opinion of the doctor, a process protocol for epistemic authority dilemmas customized for ***physician expertise level*** must be described.  \n\n***discrepancy:*** difference in recommended course of treatment; difference in output *from existing medical device*; \n***physician expertise level:*** early; proficient; expert\n\n**Owner**  \n\n- WP4\n- WP5\n- WP6\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n-   medical staff (TBD)\n-   design staff (TBD)\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** EACH (3)\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define discrepancy\n* clarify if comparison of AI and clinician will be conducted in clinical study\n* prepare process protocol outline\n* define physician expertise levels\n* completion of process protocol\n* feedback from medical staff\n* publication/research design about epistemic authority\n\n### Communicate prediction uncertainty\n\n**Description** A ***methodology*** for measuring and communicating quantitative prediction uncertainty to ***end-users*** must be established and ***validated***.\n \n***valid methodology***: *TBD*; *set of ways in which predictions will be shown in platform*   \n***end-users***: medical professionals, patients \n***validated:*** validated in clinical setting; validated in external clinical setting; validated through feedback from experts\n\n**Owner**  \n\n-   WP2\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n- medical staff (TBD)\n- technical staff\n- design staff\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** EACH (3)\n\n**Actionable tasks**  \n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define methods to communicate prediction interval\n* validation of methods\n* feedback from medical staff\n* feedback from patients and patient representatives\n* development of front-end communication for patients with specific conditions, age, education\n* publication of validation and methodology\n\n### Foster patient autonomy   \n\n**Description**  A standardized ***procedure*** for explaining ***risks*** of oversight customized for patient ***subgroups*** must be designed.  \n\n***procedure:*** video; written material; training protocol for medical staff;  \n***risks:*** procedures for epistemic authority; HIC governance structure; AI system overview    \n***subgroups:***: *speaking different languages; different education levels; different age groups; degree of disability*   \n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project.  \n\n**Stroke Phase** EACH (3)\n\n**Owner**  \n\n* WP7\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n* patient representatives\n* technical staff (TBD)\n* design staff (TBD)\n\n**Actionable tasks**\n\n* appoint key personnel\n* draft documentation\n* feedback from patients/patient representatives\n* translation of documentation\n* adaptation in simple and complex format\n* adaptation for youth\n* adaptation for visually impaired\n* adaptation for mentally impaired\n* assessment by disability experts\n* additional feedback from patients/patient representatives\n\n### Establish degree of trust\n\n**Description** Degree of ***trust*** in the STRATIF-AI platform, determined by ***end-users***, should be quantified.\n\n***trust:*** *operational definitions of trust*\n***end-users:*** medical professionals; patients with stroke; patients at risk of stroke; patients without stroke\n\n**Schedule**  At any point, before end of project. \n\n**Stroke Phase** ALL\n\n**Owner**  \n\n* WP3\n\n**Key Personnel**\n\n* patient representatives\n* medical staff\n\n**Actionable tasks**\n\n* appoint key personnel\n* define degrees of trust or conception of trust\n* design questionnaire/interview to survey trust of system\n* pre-register survey\n* execute survey with key personnel\n* report outcomes\n* translate outcomes for end-users in platform\n* disseminate outcomes in STRATIF-AI pilot studies and solicit feedback\n* publication on trust in digital twins\n\n## Human oversight\n\n### ALTAI assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nSTRATIF-AI must be constructed as a Human-in-Command system.
