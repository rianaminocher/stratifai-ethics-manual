Depending on which risks are possible or likely, please answer the questions below:\n-   Did you take measures to deal with possible negative consequences for end-users or subjects in case they develop a disproportionate attachment to the AI System?\n-   Did you take measures to minimise the risk of addiction?\n-   Did you take measures to mitigate the risk of manipulation?\n\n**Solutions:**\n\n| Solution  | Description | Key Personnel    | Indicators | Project Phase | Action Items| Notes|\n|-----------|-------------|------------------|------------|-------|-------------|------|\n|Provide training on medical decision-making | A comprehensive training program for doctors on STRATIF-AI usage and interpretation should be made available before application.
