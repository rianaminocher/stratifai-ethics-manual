{"title":"Diversity, Non-discrimination and Fairness","markdown":{"headingText":"Diversity, Non-discrimination and Fairness","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nTo ensure the trustworthiness of the STRATIF-AI platform, priority should be given to inclusion and diversity at every stage of the project lifecycle. Efforts to address historical biases, incompleteness, and governance models to mitigate the risk of unintended prejudice and discrimination should be made. Moreover, beginning with the identification and mitigation of bias from the outset is essential. Additionally, the design of STRATIF-AI systems should adhere to a user-centric approach, facilitating accessibility for all individuals, irrespective of demographic factors. This will include ensuring accessibility for persons with disabilities across diverse societal groups.\n\n**Keywords:**  \nAI bias, AI system, AI designer, AI developer, accessibility, assistive technology, end-user, fairness, subject, universal design, use case  \n\n## Avoidance of unfair bias\n\n### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}\n\nTo mitigate inadvertent creation of, or perpetuation of, biased outcomes within the AI system, input data selection and algorithmic design need to be scrutinized for bias. Throughout development, consideration will be given to the diversity and representativeness of end-users and subjects within training data. Testing protocols will be tailored to rectify potential biases, to ensure integrity and impartiality of the platform across user demographics and application scenarios. Educational initiatives aimed at cultivating awareness among AI designers and developers regarding bias and its ethical ramifications will be initiated, fostering a culture of accountability. Mechanisms for identifying and resolving issues pertaining to bias or discrimination within the STRATIF-AI platform will be established within clear communication channels. Discourse with impacted communities, particularly at-risk patient subgroups, will be conducted to ensure that the STRATIF-AI project consortium's conception of fairness resonates with diverse perspectives. A quantitative analytical framework will be embraced to measure and evaluate the efficacy the applied definition of fairness, and institute mechanisms to achieve as such. \n\n### Represent diversity in training data\n\n**Description** Inclusive representation of patients of specific (under-represented) ***subgroups*** in training data will be assessed against an acceptable ***threshold*** and rectified or reported accordingly. \n\n***subgroups:*** TBD;
