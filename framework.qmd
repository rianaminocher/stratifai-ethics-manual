# Framework {.unnumbered}

Deliverable 3.2 presents a snapshot of the **Framework for Ethical and Trustworthy Design of the STRATIF-AI platform**. 

The goal of the framework is to enumerate project-specific requirements that can help to mitigate ethical risks and increase trustworthiness throughout the STRATIF-AI project's development process (see: [Introduction](overview.qmd)). 

## Design and Use

Our framework has been designed to be a living document[^1], and, as such, will be revised following upcoming workshops, audits, and external validation. Deliverable D3.2 is a PDF document which captures a static version of the framework. The live version of the framework is is hosted [online](https://s-quest.bihealth.org/stratif-ai-ethics/) on the Charit√© server. The site is currently available under password protection to the STRATIF-AI consortium[^2], and can be made publicly available upon its finalization.

The contents of the first version of the framework were developed based on a series of co-creation workshops (see: [Workshops](workshops.qmd)). 

The framework will be updated dynamically. Planned updates will follow **(1) a focused stakeholder workshop series**, **(2) upcoming audits** of current framework adherence and **(3) an external Z-inspection** of the AI system. 

**(1) A focused stakeholder workshop series** will be conducted to complete the requirements outlined in this document. More specifically, many requirements have been planned preliminarily, but still lack specific information about parameters, methods, key personnel or planned output. These details will be completed in an iterative process during a forthcoming workshop series. 

**(2) Audits** are planned at five time points during the project, at 6-month increments, to assess adherence to the framework, potential challenges, and suggest changes to resolve issues. 

**(3) An external Z-inspection** will be conducted to assess the trustworthiness of the STRATIF-AI platform. Z-inspection is a published and validated gold standard method by which external experts use sociotechnical scenarios to derive AI trustworthiness requirements. The results of the Z-inspection process will be integrated into the framework.

## Regulatory Context

The Framework for Ethical and Trustworthy Design of the STRATIF-AI platform has been designed in concordance with the (1) **EU Guidelines for Trustworthy AI** and (2) **Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI)**. 

**The EU Guidelines for Trustworthy AI** were developed on 8 April 2019 by the High-Level Expert Group (HLEG) on AI. The guidelines aim to promote three key principles to support the development and deployment of safe AI systems---i.e., lawfulness, ethics and robustness. The principles are expounded as seven key requirements (Figure 1).

**The  Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI)** was derived on 17 July 2020 by the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG), to aid AI developers in implementing ethical principles in practice. This tool serves as a practical instrument for assessing the compliance of AI systems with the current legal and ethical framework. 

## Structure

Our framework is divided into seven sections, each corresponding to one of seven requirements set forth by the EU Guidelines for Trustworthy AI: 

* [Human Agency and Oversight](1_oversight.qmd)
* [Technical Robustness and Safety](2_technical.qmd)
* [Privacy and Data Governance](3_privacy.qmd)
* [Transparency](4_transparency.qmd)
* [Diversity, non-discrimination, and Fairness](5_diversity.qmd)
* [Societal and Environmental Wellbeing](6_societal.qmd)
* [Accountability](7_accountability.qmd)

Under each section, we provide a preliminary assessment following the questions included in the Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) checklist. 

We then describe a set of project-specific requirements. Under each project-specific requirement, we outline a set of relevant information that is either planned or *requires revision.* 

::: {.callout-note}
Under each requirement, we delineate information that requires revision and will be updated following workshops/audits in *italic text*. 
:::

### Requirement Template {.unnumbered .unlisted}

**Description** We describe each requirement briefly and nominate specific ***parameters*** which need to be expounded or addressed. 

***parameters:*** We identify specific parameters within each requirement. 

::: {.callout-note}
When a parameter has been defined, it is delineated by plain text. If a parameter is yet to be defined, we provide *prompts which will help to define parameters in future workshops, which are delineated by italic text*.  
::: 

**Owner**  

* Each requirement has an "Owner", who is responsible for its implementation.

**Key Personnel**

* Several stakeholders may serve as key personnel to contribute to or facilitate progress towards this requirement. *Named personnel* will be identified in upcoming workshops.  

**Schedule**  A preliminary schedule will be devised. 

**Stroke Phase** We identify whether this requirement pertains to all phases of stroke (prevention, acute treatment, rehabilitation) that the STRATIF-AI tool intends to treat.

**Actionable tasks**  

* Here we list a set of tasks 
* Which will be executed in order to meet this requirement
