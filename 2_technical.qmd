# Technical Robustness and Safety

AI systems must be technically robust to prevent harm, unintentional or otherwise, to human dignity, mental and physical integrity. The system must be guard against vulnerability to attack by third parties which could compromise its integrity or alter its behaviour. Safety procedures to enact in the event of errors or risks must be instituted. The accuracy of the system is of critical importance where the case for AI-assisted medical decision-making. Finally, reproducibility and reliability help to ensure that the performance and behaviour of AI system can be critically assessed.

## Resilience to attack and security

### ALTAI Assessment {.unnumbered}

In the event of technical faults, misuse or defect, STRATIF-AI could have damaging effects to human safety. The risk of vulnerability to cyber-attacks will be evaluated to ensure the system is made compliant with security standards under the Cybersecurity Act in Europe. Vulnerability to data poisoning, model evasion, model inversion will be addressed throughout model validation and testing. Measures to ensure robustness to attacks after the system has been deployed will be designed. The expected timeframe of validity for security measures need to be defined.
