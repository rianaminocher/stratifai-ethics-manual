# Human Agency and Oversight

The need to ensure respect for human autonomy encompasses the respect for a democratic, flourishing, and equitable society; the prioritization of user agency; and the necessity of human oversight for activities/uses of the AI system. This requirement is particularly important for AI systems which guide or influence human decision-making---and is thus of central importance to the STRATIF-AI project. 

**Keywords:**
guiding, influencing, decision-making (e.g., prediction systems, predictive policing, decision-support); human-like; trust and (in)dependence

**Definitions:**
human-in-the-loop (HITL): capability for human intervention in every decision cycle of the system
human-on-the-loop (HOTL): capability for human intervention during the design cycle of the system and monitoring the system's operation
human-in-command (HIC): capability to oversee the overall activity of the AI system (including its broader economic, societal, legal and ethical impact) and the ability to decide when and how to use the AI system in any particular situation---e.g., override decision or discontinue use

## Human agency and autonomy

### ALTAI assessment {.unnumbered}

STRATIF-AI is intended to guide decisions made by human end-users---i.e., both doctors and patients---, which are in turn projected to impact end-users (patients' health and autonomy, as well as doctors' autonomy) and society in general. To ensure STRATIF-AI does not generate confusion about the extent to which decision-making is guided by algorithms and the allocation of epistemic authority, a plan to disseminate information in an accessible manner to a diversity of end-users will be necessary. The risk of interpretation of a digital twin or ``personalized health coach'' as a human rather than AI system is generally believed to be low, but a risk assessment needs to be made to rule out this possibility. The risk of addiction or unhealthy attachment to the system are again deemed low, but measures to mitigate or minimize the risk of such activities need to be developed. The risk of manipulation needs to be investigated. 

### Define epistemic authority

**Description**  In the events where there is a clear conflict between the predictions of the tool and the medical opinion of the doctor, a process protocol for epistemic authority dilemmas customized for ***physician expertise level*** must be described.

***risks:***: procedures for epistemic authority; HIC governance structure; AI system  
***patients:***: language; education; age; disability

## Human oversight

### ALTAI assessment {.unnumbered}

STRATIF-AI must be constructed as a Human-in-Command system. Medical professionals need to be trained to exercise oversight according to a process protocol that has been validated. A system to detect and report misuse or adverse effects of the system must be constructed. STRATIF-AI is a self-learning system; autonomy in predictions needs to be specified to ensure human oversight/control over the type of prediction generated. 

### Establish HIC governance

**Description**  Tool is designed with ***capabilities*** to enable a Human in Command (HIC) governance structure.    

***capbilities***:  oversee the overall activity of the AI system; ability to decide whether, when and how to use the system in any particular situation; ability to override a decision made by a system

***end-users:*** medical professionals, patients  
***discrepancies:*** disagreement between system recommendation and end-user decision; end-user discomfort with system recommendation; indication of errors
